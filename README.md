# daycareful_planner

This is more of a website to help with home daycares and the tedious planning they have to keep up with. Employees, Parents, Kids, Payroll, etc. The goal is to take off some of the burden of having to keep multiple books (which can be torn up or water damaged) and make it a bit easier to manage. This will help small home daycares with managing a multitude of things all while saving them space and the headache of misplacing or having a book damaged by a kid or other accident.
